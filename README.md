TODO:
- x    black/null bg img initially until i click the extension (tbh it isnt a big problem but i do wanna fix it)
- x    would be nice to change the default null bg to some color like the default gray color perhaps
- i dont know why sometimes it will say "claudey4o" and sometimes "claudey 4o"
- x    allow the claudey thing to be turned on and off

would be nice to later implement:
- maybe make the bubbles darker so the bg img can be lighter (and mayb make slider for that?)
- Reset To Defaults button
- allow user to change font (like upload a variableweight ttf file)
- detect light/dark mode and only apply on dark mode, or also have light mode functionality
