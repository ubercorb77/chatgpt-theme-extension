## TODOs:

known bugs
- (x) black/null bg img initially until i click the extension (tbh it isnt a big problem but i do wanna fix it)
- (x) would be nice to change the default null bg to some color like the default gray color perhaps
- (x) i dont know why sometimes it will say "claudey4o" and sometimes "claudey 4o"
    - im still not 100% sure why, i only have like 60% of an answer. but it works now.
- ( ) hello.html error only on first install or wtvr
    - figured out error came from reset button (not just on other tab, but Any Time)
    - talked to claude about it https://claude.ai/chat/ceabd54e-1e07-4dd3-b2ea-578e4b93079c
    - did not yet implement most recent suggested fix
- ( ) "4o" doesnt change when you switch model
- ( ) doesnt work when doing it on different window?? tf

would be nice to implement:
- ( ) chat bubbles are claude gray but user bubbles are true gray
- ( ) need to change the popup styling bc its lowk ugly
- (x) allow the claudey thing to be turned on and off
- ( ) maybe make the bubbles darker so the bg img can be lighter (and mayb make slider for that?)
- (x) Reset To Defaults button
- (x) allow user to change font (like upload a variableweight ttf file)
- ( ) allow user to change font to some google font url
- ( ) detect light/dark mode and only apply on dark mode, or also have light mode functionality
- ( ) refactor the popup html so it's more compact / less wasted space
- ( ) remove "chrome extension made by corbin!"
- ( ) add an extra settings folder
- ( ) set up a donation page ??? or is that weird

before publishing:
- ( ) trim whitespace
- ( ) 
- ( ) clean up the error handling
- ( ) remove the debug code
    - ( ) also did i do that for the latex extension?
- ( ) screenshots
- ( ) description/etc
